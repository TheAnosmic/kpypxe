kpypxe
======

Easy(est) to setup pxe server, including a minimal dhcp server and a tftp server.

To start, all you need to do is setup some paths and IPs in the config, and run the package (\__main__) file.

requires:
---------
Python 2.7 (Should work on 2.6).
construct.

Note
----
this project it dicontinued.

I had to continue it on a different network and i can't import the changes back.

except for a Controller, and some weird BIOSes that sent weird staff - it works.

talk to me if you need any help in improving/deploying this project.
